# sample-token-broker
This repo will consist of a sample application, a sample service broker as well as a sample service. 

The goal is to showcase how easy it is to build a broker around an existing service for apps to consume. For demo purpose, the service broker will create a set of credentials on every bind-service call which the application can use to access the service REST endpoint.
